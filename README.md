## wireguard-install
WireGuard [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Ubuntu, Debian, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, CentOS and Fedora.

This script will let you set up your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used WireGuard before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

IP4 address Wireguard is 192.168.3.0 ....

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Onair-santa/wireguard-install/master/wireguard-install.sh -O wireguard-install.sh && bash wireguard-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall WireGuard.
